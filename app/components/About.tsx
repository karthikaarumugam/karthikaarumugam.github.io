            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Fueled by curiosity and passion for impact, I’ve spent 12+ years leading teams to modernize hospitality and more.
                I thrive where technology, people, and strategy meet-believing that the best results come from passionate, collaborative teams that creates real impact.
                Inspired by visionary leaders and those I’ve mentored, I’m always learning and eager to architect resilient, inclusive systems.
                Looking ahead, I’m excited to create solutions that not only solve today’s challenges but elevate experiences for tomorrow.
