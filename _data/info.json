    "summary": [
      "<strong>Hi, I’m <em>Karthika Arumugam</em>, Product Engineering Manager at Hyatt</strong>, where I get to blend my love for <strong>AI</strong>, cloud wizardry, and building <strong>secure, scalable systems</strong> that make digital transformation more than just a buzzword. With <strong>13 years in software development and leadership</strong>, I’ve helped teams turn legacy spaghetti code into modern, cloud-native masterpieces and aligned tech strategy with <em>actual business needs</em> (not just the latest shiny tool)."
    ],
    "background": [
      "I geek out over <strong>cloud architectures</strong>, <strong>DevOps</strong>, <strong>Agile everything</strong>, <strong>system design</strong>, <strong>API integrations</strong>, <strong>CI/CD automation</strong>, and <strong>cloud migrations</strong>—basically, if it makes systems run <strong>smoother, faster, and safer</strong>, I’m in. My favorite wins? <strong>Delivering high-impact solutions</strong> that boost efficiency, nail <strong>security compliance</strong>, and make users (and stakeholders) smile across hospitality, travel, and enterprise tech.",
      "But let’s talk people: I’m passionate about <strong>mentoring engineers</strong>, streamlining processes, and building teams where <strong>innovation and collaboration</strong> are the norm (not just something we put on a slide deck). I believe <strong>empowered, diverse teams</strong> are unstoppable, and I’m all about creating a culture where <strong>continuous improvement</strong> isn’t just encouraged—it’s <em>celebrated</em>."
    ],
    "hobbies": "When I’m not wrangling code or leading teams, you’ll probably find me on a <strong>family adventure</strong> (travel bug fully activated), teaching my two little ones the wonders of <strong>STEM</strong> (and how to build a robot out of LEGOs), or hosting friends for impromptu <strong>game nights</strong>. For downtime, I <strong>crochet</strong>, <strong>knit</strong>, and design homemade clothes for my daughter—think <em>“Project Runway: Toddler Edition”</em>. I also love exploring <strong>emerging tech</strong>, contributing to <strong>open-source projects</strong>, and finding new ways to blend <strong>creativity and code</strong>. <strong>Always learning, always building, always up for a challenge</strong>—especially if it involves coffee, cloud, or crafts."
